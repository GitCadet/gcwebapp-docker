#  üê≥ GitCadet: Dockerised Webpage

This repository contains a custom docker webapp, packaged and hosted using NGINX. Below, you'll find a detailed breakdown of how I built, tagged, versioned, and then pushed the Docker image to a Docker registry, as well as some instructions for running the container. Additionally, I share key learnings gained during this process.

---

## Building the Docker Image
In order to build GitCadet custom webpage, I first specified a Dockerfile that included a "`FROM nginx:latest`" in order to set the base image. Then, I copied the files & directories from source to the destination filesystem of the image by using "`ADD . /usr/share/nginx/html`". 


### Tagging & Versioning:
To maintain a professional development workflow, I implemented a clear versioning strategy:

Initial Tagging:
- Tagged the image as `website:latest` during initial development.

Versioned Tags:
Followed semantic versioning for iterative releases, tagging subsequent builds as:
- `website:1`
- `website:2`
- `website:3`

This approach allows for organised deployments and easy rollback if necessary.

Best Practice:
Avoid using latest in production deployments to prevent unexpected changes from upstream updates.

## Running the Docker Container

Run the Docker container using `docker run --name gcwebL -d -p 800:80 website:latest`
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode.
- `-p 800:80`: Maps port 800 of the host to port 80 on the container.
- `--name`: Assigns a name to the container for easier management.

I then verified the container is running using the `docker ps` command. Once verified, I accessed the application by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in my browser.

## Pushing to Docker Registry
To share my Docker image, I pushed it to DockerHub by following these steps:

### Step 1: Authenticate with Docker Hub
Logged in to Docker Hub using Docker Desktop.

### Step 2: Push the Image
Pushed the tagged image to my Docker Hub repo:
- `docker push dock8pro/website:latest`

For versioned images:
- `docker push dock8pro/website:1`
- `docker push dock8pro/website:2`
- `docker push dock8pro/website:3`
### Step 3: Verify the Image
I checked my Docker Hub repository to confirm the image is available.
## Key Learnings and Improvements
1. **Reducing Image Size:** Using Alpine Linux significantly reduces the image size, which leads to faster builds and deployments, hence I changed the Dockerfile to read `FROM nginx:1.27.3-alpine`.
2. **Security Best Practices:** Use specific image versions instead of `latest` to avoid unexpected changes.
